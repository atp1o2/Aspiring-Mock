                <strong>Counter Notice Procedure</strong>
              </li>
              <p>
                If you believe your own copyrighted material has been removed from the Service in error, you may submit a written Counter Notice to our Designated Agent (as identified above) that includes the following:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Identification of the material that has been removed or disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court in which your address is located, or if your address is outside the United States, the Central District of California or any other judicial district in which Career Scope may
                    be found.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A statement that you will accept service of process from the party that filed the Notice or the party's agent.

                  Your name, address and telephone number.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material in question was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your physical or electronic signature.

              <p>
                If you send our Designated Agent a valid, written Counter Notice meeting the requirements described above, we will restore your removed or disabled material within 10 to 14 business days from the date we receive your Counter Notification, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice from the party filing the original Notice informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question.

              <p>
                Please note that if you misrepresent that the disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs and attorney's fees.

                <strong>Repeat Infringer Policy Career</strong>
              </li>
              <p>
                Scope may withdraw all rights and privileges relating to the Service from any user who is deemed to be a repeat infringer. This determination will be based on the number of “strikes” against the user. A “strike” is counted against a user each time there is either: (i) an adjudication by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction that the user has engaged in copyright infringement of any kind in relation to the Service; or (ii) Career Scope has actual knowledge, regardless of any such adjudication, that the user has engaged in any such copyright infringement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each adjudication or instance of knowledge counts as a separate strike. If an adjudication or instance of knowledge pertains to multiple instances of copyright infringement, it can count as multiple strikes. Career Scope has adopted a “three strikes and you’re out” policy under which a user who accumulates three strikes is considered a repeat infringer and may be subject to account termination.
